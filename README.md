# GROOT - AI-Driven Plant Disease Prediction and Management System ðŸŒ±

GROOT is an innovative, cross-platform mobile and web application developed to assist farmers in diagnosing plant diseases and providing actionable remedies. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, GROOT analyzes crop images and environmental data to identify potential disease outbreaks, enabling farmers to act promptly and improve crop health.

## Key Features

- **Instant Disease Detection**: Farmers can capture plant images through the app, which are then analyzed by integrated machine learning models to quickly identify diseases.
- **Tailored Solutions**: The app provides detailed information on disease causes, symptoms, and recommended treatments based on the diagnosis.
- **Conversational AI Support**: Farmers can engage with a conversational AI chatbot for personalized guidance on plant diseases, crop health, and more.
- **Multilingual and Accessibility Support**: GROOT offers support for multiple languages, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech functionalities to accommodate diverse user needs.
- **Offline Functionality**: Equipped with pre-loaded crop modules, the app remains fully functional offline, making it accessible to farmers in remote areas without internet access.
- **Low Resource Requirements**: Optimized for basic smartphones to ensure accessibility for a broader audience.

## Technology Stack

- **Flutter**: For a seamless cross-platform experience on mobile and web.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Inception v3, ResNet50, and MobileNet power high-accuracy image recognition capabilities optimized for mobile use.
- **Conversational AI**: Fine-tuned with LLaMA2 to provide tailored advice and recommendations.
- **Speech-to-Text Integration**: Allows easy interaction with the app, even for farmers with limited literacy.
